Two misconceptions about bees are manifested in the english language:
- _**queen bee (noun):** A woman who has a dominant or controlling position in a particular group or sphere_
- _**hive mind (noun):** A notional entity consisting of a large number of people who share their knowledge or opinions with one another, regarded as producing either uncritical conformity or collective intelligence._

In reality, bee decision-making is much more complex than following the wills of a singular ruler. In fact, the queen isn't much of a leader at all!

Instead, bees communicate with one-another to collectively make decisions. And they do this by dancing!

Sometimes bees have to make important decisions that affect the whole colony like where to move to find a new hive. Scouts investigate the options and dance the directions to their sisters to tell them where to check.

Not all options are created equal. The bees use democracy to decide which option to actually commit to.

It's important to note that honeybees exist in a "unitary democracy" meaning that all the bees share a common interest.
