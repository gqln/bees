## Have you heard these terms?
- _**queen bee (noun):** A woman who has a dominant or controlling position in a particular group or sphere_
- _**hive mind (noun):** A notional entity consisting of a large number of people who share their knowledge or opinions with one another, regarded as producing either uncritical conformity or collective intelligence._

Unfortunately, bees have been egregiously misrepresented by these stereotypes. In reality, honey bee decision-making is much more complex than following the wills of a singular ruler. In fact, the queen isn't much of a leader at all!

## Dance Dance Democracy

Instead, honey bees communicate with one-another to collectively make decisions. And they do this by dancing!

Sometimes bees have to make important decisions that affect the whole colony like where to move to build a new hive. Scouts investigate the hive site options and dance the directions to their sisters to tell them where to go check.

Not all potential sites are created equal. The bees use democracy to decide which option to actually move to for their new hive.

> It's important to note that honeybees exist in a "unitary democracy" meaning that all the bees share a common interest.

Honey bee scouts advocate for specific site locations by repeating their dance.
