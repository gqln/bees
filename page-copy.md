~~Honey bees can be found all over the world. While many species of bees are important pollinators, honey bees are especially well-known for their production of honey. Despite their popularity, bees also have come to be associated with some harmful stereotypes.~~

## What comes to mind when you think about bees?

Two common misconceptions about bees are manifested in the english language:
- _**queen bee (noun):** A woman who has a dominant or controlling position in a particular group or sphere_
- _**hive mind (noun):** A notional entity consisting of a large number of people who share their knowledge or opinions with one another, regarded as producing either uncritical conformity or collective intelligence._

In reality, bee decision-making is much more complex than following the wills of a singular ruler. In fact, the queen isn't much of a leader at all!

## Dance Dance Democracy

Instead, bees communicate with one-another to collectively make decisions. And they do this by dancing!

To make important decisions like where to move the hive, bees consider several options before making a choice.
